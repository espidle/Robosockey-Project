# Robosockey-Project
Files and code used to create robot for Robosockey in Intro to Engineering Design II. Robosockey is a game where four robots are placed onto a field with 12 balls. The robot must find a ball and deliver it to the goal. The robot with the most points win. Our robot utilized an Arduino microcontroller as its 'brain' and used Infared Distance sensors to navigate around the arena. To pick up a ball and score it the robot utilized a paint roller connected to a servo motor and the robot utilized DC motors to move around the arena. All of the components were controlled and monitored through a program written in the Arduino IDE. THe code was then uploaded to the robot and it ran autonomously after the start button was pressed.
